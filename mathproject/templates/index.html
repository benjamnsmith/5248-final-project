            This is my MATH5248 final project. We are going to dive into two comonly used internet encryption schemes, RSA and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman, 
            to learn about how they work in practice, and what impact quantum computing will have on their security. This project is aimed at other MATH5248 students
            who are interested in seeing the applications of therorems and cryptosystems we learned throughout the semester, as well as their relevance in 
            a post-quantum cryptograhic future. 
        </p>

            It may be worth going over a bit about the history (and future) of quantum computing. Let's do that now.
            Classical computers operate on bits, which can be either on (1) or off (0). Quantum computers, on the other hand,
            use qubits. However, their state can not be represented as an integer, but instead as a vector representing the potential
            states it could decompose into. So, a qubit can be a 1, a 0, or (most commonly) a vector. See the image to the right for a visualization. 
            We are limited in classical machines by the speed at which we can do base 2 math (Boolean algebra), but in quantum machines we are able 
            to do a bit more complex math by instead doing math across these vectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quantum computing thus introduces a whole new set of basic operators (logic gates) then on classical machines, and indeed encompass
            a completely new field of math than classical machines. In the coming pages, we are going to examine two different cryptosystems, 
            RSA and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH). We will examine how they are used in practice today, as well as the challenges
            posed to them by both classical and quantum computing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am not a physicist, but widespread quantum computing of the magnitude that could pose a threat to our cryptosystems
            as they exist currently is not in the near future. We can barely factor $21 = 7 \cdot 3$ using a quantum computer, let alone a number with
            100s of digits. The largest number successfully factored on a classical computer had 232 digits, and our security relies on numbers that have 
            $2^{2048}$ (or more) bits, which is about 620 digits.
